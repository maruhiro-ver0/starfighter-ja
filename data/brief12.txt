What have you found out about that experimental fighter?
FACE_SID
It's got some kind of cloaking device that makes it invisible to radar. Could prove hard to track down.
FACE_CHRIS
I'll just have to run around the system until I run into it.
FACE_SID
It's likely to run away if you engage it in battle, so try and do as much damage to it as possible.
