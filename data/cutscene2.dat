We're nearly ready to make the jump to Eyananth.
FACE_CHRIS
Aren't there a lot of WEAPCO slaves in this system?
FACE_SID
Correct. It's got one of the highest mortality rates in the galaxy.
FACE_CHRIS
You think we can use that to our advantage?
FACE_SID
I think so. I'll come up with a plan of action.
FACE_SID
Just remember that we won't be in Spirit anymore and you may run into WEAPCO patrols while travelling.
FACE_CHRIS
Sounds like fun!
