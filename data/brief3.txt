Wow! Missile boats?
FACE_SID
Yup. Looks like WEAPCO is starting to take notice of your actions.

Sounds like fun! This will really put the Firefly's fighting ability to the test!

Please be careful, Chris. A single missile boat carries enough rockets to level most major cities. Try not to face them head-on, and keep your distance.
