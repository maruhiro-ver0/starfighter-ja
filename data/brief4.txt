We're going to have to get rid of the mine deployment unit around Joldar. The minefield is stopping interplanetary traffic.

Sounds kind of boring. Any fighters?

Not at the moment, but that doesn't mean they won't turn up. Be very careful of those mines! They'll only explode when they encounter a ship that's not transmitting a WEAPCO signal. Shoot them down if they get in your way.
