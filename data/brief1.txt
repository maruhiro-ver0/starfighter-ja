Hey, boy! You still owe me money for the Firefly I stole for you! But instead, I want you to go to the WEAPCO training ground and destroy all the craft there.
FACE_CHRIS
Oh? That's the job I contracted you to do, was it not?
FACE_KRASS
I know, but this way we can resolve your debt right now. Do this job, and also collect $500, and we will call it quits. And if you die... well, I guess the ship was not worth stealing! HA HA HA!
FACE_CHRIS
As usual, you take me too lightly, Krass.
