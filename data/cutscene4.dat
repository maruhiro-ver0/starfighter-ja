What happened back there, Chris? The video feed was jammed.
FACE_CHRIS
We took down the WEAPCO mining vessel and then I was jumped by a man claiming to be Kline Kethlan.
FACE_SID
I've heard of him. He's the Commander of WEAPCO's naval forces. One of the best pilots they ever had.
FACE_CHRIS
He did put up one hell of a fight! He didn't stick around for long, though. I guess he was just testing me.
FACE_CHRIS
Anyway, what's the scoop on Mordor, Sid?
FACE_SID
I've learned from the scientist we captured that WEAPCO is testing a new fighter craft there.
FACE_CHRIS
We should probably destroy that craft, then. We might be able to thwart its development somewhat.
FACE_SID
Agreed.
FACE_PHOEBE
I wonder if my sister will be here...
