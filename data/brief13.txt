I've located my sister's ship currently in orbit around Odeon. She's ignoring my hails though.

Something's off here. She seems to be travelling freely with a WEAPCO group.
FACE_CHRIS
Do you think she's turned traitor?
FACE_PHOEBE
No way. She hates WEAPCO with a passion.
FACE_SID
She must be under some kind of mind control. I've heard of WEAPCO developing a new "AI training program" recently. We'd better rescue her!
