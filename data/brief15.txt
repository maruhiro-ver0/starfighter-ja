Seems like taking out that WEAPCO mining ship wasn't such a good idea. The Ore it collected from those asteroids is needed in weapon production.

Damn! I guess that means I'll have to mine some myself, then, huh?
FACE_SID
Yes. Be careful, Chris. Your weapons weren't designed for that sort of work and could have some devastating results.
